# newsletter-backend

A school project. Effectively, just a demonstration of a login/subscription system that relies on a separately hosted mongodb database (on atlas), a backend (on heroku) and a frontend, hosted right here.

If you don't know what this is, though, I doubt you'll find anything of interest here!

Frontend and a brief guide can be found at https://github.com/ToniHalmetoja/newsletter-frontend/
